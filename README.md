# LearnSomething

There are many things I want to say. The motivation of creating this repo began with my experience of finding first internship. It's like, when most of us are still enjoying the foam of the prosperity of the WEB, the reality suddenly knocked me out and all those imaginaries disappeared. It's like, we didn't even notice how serious the situation was when we found that the PPT of our courses are mostly from **10** years ago. We didn't even know how powerful the newest tech and most advanced structures were at the time. We were paralyzed. You might say, 'Hey, students! What they need to do is just to learn how to learn!'. I'm afraid I don't agree with that opinion because we are already undergraduates. New techs, new structures reflect new theories and novel thoughts. You can never denied it to hide the neglect of duty of those teachers. We lost a lot under the indolence of both teachers and ourselves.

But it's never too late before we still have the ability and chance to learn new things. We need to catch up.
