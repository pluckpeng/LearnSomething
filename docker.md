## Docker
Docker is cool. Now image it if you and your friends are doing a WEB project. You guys have done all the codes. It's time to deploy it on the server. Image it you will still have a lot to do like configuring the environment and components like database and dependencies to systhesise with the development environment. But with docker you don't have to do all this trivials. All you need to do is upload your packed file to the docker hub then download it on the server with some simple cmds. REALLY COOL. I'm gonna try this in my next course project. *BUILD, SHIP and RUN!*

## Introduction.
Docker is more like a mini-OS. It is responsible for the management of both resources and processes. Because of the consistency of the process of build and deploy, the whole development process is largely compressed. You don't have to concern with the details but just focus on your work.
